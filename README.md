# Todo
Todo is a full stack application for adding, deleting, searching and editing your to-do tasks.




## 1. Requirements / Intro
You need to implement a simple web application that allows you to take notes, tag and filter them. The
development is divided in two phases:
* Phase 1: note creation
* Phase 2: tag application and filtering

**IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:**
* **Phase 1 is mandatory** to pass this exercise, while Phase 2 will provide extra points if done.
* **Content should be persisted in a relational database by using an ORM** - in-memory
storage or mocks are not allowed.
## 2. Deliverables
To pass this exercise, in addition to the implementation, you must
* Upload the code to a private **GitHub repository** given by Ensolvers HR staff and use git properly. **Both the frontend and the backend should be pushed to that repository**, in folders named backend and frontend respectively.
* Include a bash / zsh script allowing to run the app - ideally, the app should start in a Linux/macOS environment just running one command. This command should set up everything that is required to run the app like, for instance, setting up a DB schema,
pre-creating any config file, etc.
* Include a **README.md** file describing all the runtimes, engines, tools etc. required to run the app, with their concrete versions - for instance, MySQL 5.7, Spring Boot 2.1, React 16.10, etc.
## 3. Technologies
There is no restriction about the technology to be used, if the **implementation satisfies the
following:**
* Structure the app as a **Single Page web Application**, i.e. frontend and backend are different
apps. That is the general case when you use React, Angular, Vue.js or any other similar UI
framework. Please consider that rendering a web page on the server-side (by using JSP, EJS,
Smarty, Blade, etc.) but using a bit of JS to, for instance, fetch some data, is not a pure SPA.
You need to implement an isolated app, **in a separate folder, with its custom package.json**
and dependencies.
* The backend app exposes a **REST API** that is the way in which the frontend app communicates with the backend
* The backend app is **separated into layers** (e.g., Controllers, Services, DAOs/Repositories, etc.). **It is important to mention that Laravel (PHP) and Django (Python) DO NOT SUPPORT that layer separation by default when building apps, so if you submit a backend done directly with those technologies without any further adjustment in the architecture, it might probably need to be improved or the exercise will be rejected directly**. On the other hand, Spring Boot (Java) and Nestjs (Node.js) are two technologies that enforce and/or ease the use of this layer separation. For more information, you can check
the definition of the [Service Layer pattern](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html) and an [example](https://www.sourcecodeexamples.net/2021/08/spring-boot-project-with-controller.html) in Spring Boot
## 4. User Stories and mockups
### Phase 1

**User Stories**
* As a user, I want to be able to create, edit and delete notes
* As a user, I want to archive/unarchive notes
* As a user, I want to list both my active notes
* As a user, I want to list both my archived notes

**Mockups for active and archived notes**

NOTE: these mockups are for reference purposes only, different variants of user interface can be
accepted if they match the desired functionality as described in the user stories.

### Phase 2
User stories
* As a user, I want to be able to add/remove categories to notes
* As a user, I want to be able to filter notes by category

## 5. Extra functional and non-functional requirements
These features will provide EXTRA POINTS to your exercise results if done
* Login: If you provide a login screen that allows users to log in and out from the app - you need to document the default user/password used in README.md.
* Live deployed version: If you deploy the app (for instance via Heroku) and you share the URL of the live running version.
